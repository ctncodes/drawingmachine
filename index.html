<h1>Drawing <em>Machines</em> vs <em>Drawing</em> Machines</h1>
<h2>Starring Mona Lisa as our judge.</h2>
<h3>Remember: The alphabet's first 15 letters (A to O) are for saving all the images, from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.</h3>
<h3><span style="color:#6e5648;">Artist Statement:</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#6e5648;">Just the title of Art 101's third project - "Drawing Machine" - helped me to conceive my artwork. Because who knows drawings and machines better than Leonardo da Vinci? So, my Drawing Machine contains 15 canvases to draw and save images, to reflect Da Vinci's own productivity in the arts, sciences and other fields of interest. And just like Da Vinci, I made my own artistic discovery: nowadays, there's a subtle difference between <em>drawing</em> machines (as in people making mechanical sketches) and drawing <em>machines</em> (meaning machines themselves are becoming creative). Knowing this means that humans are changing theirs roles as artists, I just had to share my discovery with the world, the very idea behind writing this artist statement.</span></h3>
